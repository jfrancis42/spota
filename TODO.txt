TODO: Fix band calculations for non-USA. Maybe do W=c/F and round?

TODO: Deal with center_own state properly in Three/show().

TODO: Add the rest of the gone_freq list.

TODO: Clean up the whole mobile bands thing.

TODO: Read config from a file.

TODO: Display the newest spot when there's a hash collision (ie, more than one).

TODO: Tune to the newest spot when there's a hash collision (ie, more than one).

TODO: Think about using the lat/lon data in the POTA spots and
      fetching lat/lon from the SOTA spots and calculating distances
      and bearings from the operator to the spot location. When
      combined with ToD and band information, this might lead to
      suggesting most likely spots to be reachable at the current time
      (as well as historically).

TODO: Expire old spots from the arrays so things don't grow without
      bounds. Probably not really necessary with gigs of ram and low
      volumes of data, but it's the principle of the thing.

TODO: Do something smarter with the pointer when hiding a spot. Don't
      force it back to the top.
